Tableau dashboard and SQL queries exploring sales data.
<br>
<br>
The sample data was obtained from [eforexcel.com](https://eforexcel.com/wp/).
The exact sample data can be downloaded [here](https://eforexcel.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/50000-Sales-Records.zip).
<br>
The data contains 50,000 rows of .csv data and 14 columns of a variety of sales data for a hypothetical global company.

## Tableau Dashboard
I first made a Tableau dashboard using Tableau Public to help me get a better feel for what the data looked like. I ended up madking 5 worksheets and a dashboard to tie it all together. My Tableau Public workbook can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/DASH1_16484363300500/InteractiveMap?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
<br><br>
Here's what the dashboard looks like:<br>![Picture101](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46659404/160330375-24ac2747-e70b-4790-b79c-9397ea48b219.png)
<br><br>
My goal was to make a single dashboard that can filter out by region, country, and product type to get the best feel for the data in one view.
